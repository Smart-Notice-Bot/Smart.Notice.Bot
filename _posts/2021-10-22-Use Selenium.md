We used selenium crawling important information on the website.<br>
```
conda install selenium
pip install selenium

from selenium import webdriver
```

 The crawling data was selected as the main interests of students. (e.g., graduate school, internship, notice, employment, start-up, etc.).<br>
 ❓ So how do we collect these interests? <br>
 💡 we planned to create a new web page and receive information here!
